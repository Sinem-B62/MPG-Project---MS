# MPG-Project---MS
As part of this project, I conducted an extensive data analysis of vehicles using Python. The objective was to identify patterns and correlations between vehicle attributes such as engine performance, price, fuel efficiency (MPG), drivetrain, and transmission type.

Dataset Description
This dataset contains vehicle information from the years 2011 to 2013. Each row represents a vehicle model with the following attributes:

Make and Model

Year

Engine Fuel Type

Engine Horsepower (HP) and Number of Cylinders

Transmission Type

Driven Wheels

Number of Doors

Market Category (e.g., Luxury, High-Performance)

Vehicle Size and Vehicle Style

Fuel Efficiency (highway MPG, city MPG)

Popularity

Manufacturerâ€™s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)

This dataset provides a comprehensive basis for analyzing relationships between vehicle features, engine performance, fuel consumption, and price.
